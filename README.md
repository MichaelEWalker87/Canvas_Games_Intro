# Brick Braker

 Project made to get hands-on practice with Canvas and game development. This project tracks a Udemy course in game design. The application is a classic videogame recreation of Brick Breaker. The user can control the paddle with the mouse tracking motion and use the paddle to direct the ball placement. If the player loses or the ball goes out of play, the board will reset.
